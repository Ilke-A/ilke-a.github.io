The goal of this project was to improve the facial rig quality and animation for *Mafia 2: Definitive Edition*.

I worked on upgrading the facial meshes as well as the face rigs.

The improvement of the meshes for the head were done with great care for the likeness of the original character meshes.
It was important to maintain the likeness and feel of the characters but with a higher resolution mesh which was necessary for making a new facial rig.

After upgrading the meshes I created new facial rigs with our internal rigging tools.
These rigs used only joints for the facial expressions and all expressions were made based on FACS.
