This is a facial rig that I made during the CGMA workshop Character facial rigging for production, by Wade Ryer.

The workshop was a 8 week course. The main setup for the face, such as the jaw, ears, eyes and nose are made with joints. The eyelids has an advanced joint set up that uses wire deformers as well. The rest of the facial rig, such as eyebrows and lips, is made with blendshapes.

The squash and stretch is made with a lattice deformer.
