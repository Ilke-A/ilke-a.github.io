<div class="project-info" markdown="1">

This is Allison. A character made for Wonder Media. I made the body and face rig for this character. 
The rig was made in a short amount of time due to deadline for this project. 

About the rig:
- The **spine** has an IK setup with FK possibilities as well as squash and stretch. 
- The **arms and legs** are stretchable and have an elbow/knee lock option. They can twist, both upper arm/leg as lower arm/leg.
- The **facial rig** has joint based setup with additional blendshapes for blinking and a few other facial deformations.

This rig was made to work in Animation Now, the custom real time animation software from Wonder Media. 
Animation Now works similar to game engines. Therefor the rig uses only joints and blendshapes.
