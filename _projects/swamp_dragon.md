Creature sculpt and rig of a swamp dragon.

The sculpt was made in ZBrush and retopologized in Maya. 
The dragon has a high poly mesh and a low poly mesh, to allow for faster animation.

The rig was made in Maya:
- The spine of the dragon has a sine deformer that can be adjusted from the main spine control and can create a slithering animation
- The spine has additional IK and FK controls, all controls can be combined in use
- The head has basic controls for the jaw, tongue and eyes
