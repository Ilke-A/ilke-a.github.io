I worked as a facial rigger and blendshape modeler on the different face rigs for the live performance of K/DA in the opening ceremony of the League of Legends Worlds 2020 Finals.

Before this event I also worked on the face rig of Akali for the League of Legends Pro League in 2019. This rig was made using the same workflow that would be used for the rigs for the KDA performance. 
It set the first quality standard and requirements for the K/DA rigs.
