<div class="project-info" markdown="1">

This is Zumi. A little alien made at Wonder Media. This was an existing character the was being renewed. This also meant a new rig, which I made.

The body rig has twisting and stretching capabilities as well as an elbow/knee lock. 

The facial rig is made with only blendshapes, besides the ears and eyes. The blendshapes were not made by me.

This rig was made to work in Animation Now, which is the custom real time animation software from Wonder Media. Animation Now works similar to game engines. Therefor the rig is made with only joints and blendshapes.
