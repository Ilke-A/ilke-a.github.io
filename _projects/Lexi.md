I worked as a facial rigger and blendshape modeler on a digital version of Lexi.

Digital Lexi is based off of the actress, Alexa Lee, whom Cubic Motion has worked with previously. She was meant to show off what a next gen digital human could look like, being driven by Cubic Motions real time motion capture & animation pipeline.
