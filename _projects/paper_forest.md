This project was my university graduation work. The main focus was to create the feeling of paper in 3D both in visuals and in animation.

The project had to made in 6 weeks. The first 2 weeks were for research. 
I did research on the following topics:
- Creating the feeling of paper and the different styles of 3D 'paper' animation that existed
- Which 3D techniques and tools would be most effecient to re-create the different animation styles

The other 4 weeks were spent on creating the final models, rigs, animations and renders.
