I provided rigging support for the *Yakuza 7: Like a Dragon* dub to English.

Because of fundamental differences in speech between Japanese and English the facial rigs for *Yakuza 7: Like a Dragon* were adjusted to fit the needs for the animators working on the English dub.

To meet the needs of the animators a new rig was made for the lower face to get the best results for the lipsync animation in English.
The rigs were made in Maya with in house rigging tools.
